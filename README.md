# Creating-learning-pathway
The project is all about creating a pathway to learn certain topic. Which means to learn some topic we need to learn few basics before that to understand it better. So we create a pathway which showcase how to learn any topic, as a part of sample we took a bunch of khan academy videos from standard 1 to standard 10 mathematics topics and from all those videos we developed a pathway saying which video should be watched first so that the next topic will be much better and easily understandable.

Topics I learned during this project 
- Network sciences 
- Natural Language Processing 
- Pandas
